# A Survey on Data-driven Software Vulnerability Assessment and Prioritization

- Software vulnerabilities are increasing in complexity and scale
- Increase in machine learning for assessment and prioritization
- Also discuss current limitations

## Introduction

Can affect confidentiality, integrity and availability of software systems, such as Heartbleed,
therefore important to remediate as promptly as possible

### Vulnerability Assessment

- More than 20000 SVs in NVD in 2021

Assessment entails:

- determining:
    - types
    - exploitability
    - impact
    - severity level
- These are needed to reason as to the level of prioritization needed for a given SV
    - Example given of a cross-site scripting attack needing to be resolved quickly---deemed as high
      threat due to only needing unauthorized access and so readily accessible---.
- Active research which is increasing. Generally making use of:
    - NLP
    - ML
    - DL
    to automate the prediction of CVSS metrics or public exploits.
- Models are able to due this by learning the patterns automatically from the vast SV data.---Unsure
  if I would call it vast from a ML standpoint, says impossible manually, but that is what is
currently done?---

### Key contributions:
- First to do in-depth review of studies that automate data-driven SV assessment and
prioritization tasks leveraging SV data and NLP/ML/DL techniques.
- Categorize the key tasks preformed in relevant primary studies
- Synthesize and discuss the pross and cons of data, features, models, evaluation methods, and
metrics commonly used in the reviewed studies
- Highlight the challenges with the current practices and propose potential solutions moving
forward.

Focus on the challenges, solutions and practices of automating various SV assessment and
prioritization tasks with data-driven techiniques

## Overview

Discovery phase:
    - locates hot spots that contain many highly ciritical/severe SVs and require higher attention
in a system
Assessment phase:
    - unveils the characteristics of the SVs
Prioritization phase:
    - practitioners use the assessment outputs to device and optimal remediation plan
Remediation phase:
    - Fix the things

--- In hindsight, this doesnt really feel like this was necessary. ---

Survey intends to focus on the SV data in the wild as opposed to the rule/experience based
assessment and prioritization. Only surveying papers which use data-driven methods/models, no manual
analysis.

Don't directly compare the results as they do not necessarily match up.

## Methodology

Big ol boolean string 
```
software AND vulner* AND (learn* OR data* OR predict*) AND (priority* OR assess* OR impact* OR exploit*
OR severity*) AND NOT (fuzz* OR dynamic* OR intrusion OR adversari* OR malware* OR vulnerability detection’ OR vulnerability discovery’ OR vulnerability identification’ OR vulnerability prediction’).
```
84 papers included

### Thematic analysis

Followed these steps to identify the taxonomy:
- Pilot study of 20 papers to identify the data to be extracted
- Generated initial codes??? Merged interatively to create themes
- Two authors did the analysis independently and contrasted their findings

The five major themes are:

- Exploitation
    - exploit likelihood
    - exploit time
    - exploit characteristics
- Impact
    - Confidentiality
    - Integrity
    - Availability
    - Scope
    - Custom Vulnerability Consequences
- Severity
    - Severe vs. Non-severe
    - Score
    - Levels
- Type
    - Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)
- Miscellaneous tasks
    - Vulnerability Information Retrieval
    - Cross-source Vulnerability Patterns
    -  Vulnerability Fixing Effort

## Exploitation Prediction

Focuses on automating the detection and understanding of both proof-of-concept and real-world
exploits, it outputs:

- Origin of SV
- How the SVs are taken advantage of by attackers
- Assisting security practitioners to react quicker
