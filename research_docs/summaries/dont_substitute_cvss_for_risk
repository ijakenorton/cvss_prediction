Links to this https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-3735, example of limitations of CVSS, used
for far more than it should be

Companies use the CVSS score on unfixed vulnerabilities and CVSS scores

Probabilities of exploitation is the highest importance

"But as we shall see from the following analysis, a vulnerability itself, taken out of context,
cannot be equated to risk. Furthermore, CVSS has an inherent problem in that the impact is averaged
against the exploitability: From the attackerâ€™s perspective, this is a mistake, because threat
actors exploit vulnerabilities to suit their goals, not just because something is easy."

The openssl exploit in reality should be rated very low as the impact is limited to a small text
display, however it is rated as 5 - 7.5 depending on which CVSS version which is misleading 

The impact of the exploit is also of paramount importance, it is a waste of a hackers time to do an
easy exploit if they don't gain much from it

"Attackers exploit vulnerabilitiethat further their goals."

Again CVSS should be used in tandem with other tools.

Should be used as an initial guideline for further analysis, triage

"Still, despite the importance of CVSS to vulnerability triage, it is a mistake to confuse a CVSS
score with a risk rating, as we shall see."
