Towards Improving CVSS

CVSS scoring isnt justified

Missuse is widespread

Base scores as direct vulnerability prioritization may be policy-- US government-- and payment card
industry

Mathematical operations is not defined between ordinal data

Creates regression formula based on unspecified methods, no evidence or argument in favour of the
robustness of the given formula

CVSS scores severity not risk

CVSS is designed to identify the technical severity of a vulnerability, people want to know risk of
a vulnerability or flaw 

CVSS does not account for
    the type of information processed,
    the proper operation of the system
    the context in whicn the vulnerable software is used
    the material consequences of an attack

Failure to account for context
    Broadly
        Shared libraries
            One size fits all does not capture complexity
        Related or chained vulnerabilities
            Only scope, maybe 4 helps with this?
        Web vulnerabilities
        Different interpretations of CVSS
            Too simple
                Failure to account for complexities
            No guidance on how communities should intepret scores, such as how to map actions or
            responses to either numbers or severity categories
        Issues of context
            Mitre worked with food and drug peeps to adjust stuff to the medical device context,
            designed for more traditional IT vulnerabilities

Failure to account for threat and consequences of vulnerability

Should consider materical consequences? Threat likelihood and security issues that are not strictly
defined as vulnerabilities. Intuitively if a vulnerability will plausibly harm humans or physical
property, then it should be severe, e.g weapons, cars but CVSS does not account for this, not easy
to fix
Isn't this sorted by the environmental factors?

Temporal metrics attempt to address exploit likelihood, but the default value assumes widespread
exploitation which is not realistic

Good evidence to suggest attackers are work-averse and only develop exploits when economically
advantageous, exploit likelihood is not prioritized enough

Look into CMSS and CCSS

Operational Problems with scoring

Assigning scores, inconsistency and inflation, vague guidelines

Experts score things with a wide range of error / difference

Scores inflate over time

A way forward

The scoring system needs to be redone from scratch
Should be a clear rubric, tested by three scorers reaching high agreement

Should be two-scorer agreement
