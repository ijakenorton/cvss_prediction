                 'uploading an SVG asset. When the asset is uploaded, a '
                 'filtering mechanism is performed to validate that the SVG '
                 'does not contain malicious code. The validation logic '
                 'consists of traversing the HTML nodes in the DOM. In order '
                 'for the validation to succeed, 2 conditions must be met: 1. '

                 'call Argo CD API endpoints on the victim’s behalf. For '
                 'example, an attacker could send an Argo CD user a link to a '
                 'page which looks harmless but in the background calls an '
                 'Argo CD API endpoint to create an application running '
                 'malicious code. Argo CD uses the “Lax” SameSite cookie '
                 'policy to prevent CSRF attacks where the attacker controls '
                 'an external domain. The malicious external website can '
                 'attempt to call the Argo CD API, but the web browser will '
                 'refuse to send the Argo CD auth token with the request. Many '
                 'companies host Argo CD on an internal subdomain. If an '
                 'attacker can place malicious code on, for example, '
                 'https://test.internal.example.com/, they can still perform a '
                 'CSRF attack. In this case, the “Lax” SameSite cookie does '
                 'not prevent the browser from sending the auth cookie, '
                 'because the destination is a parent domain of the Argo CD '
                 'API. Browsers generally block such attacks by applying CORS '
                 'policies to sensitive requests with sensitive content types. '
                 'Specifically, browsers will send a “preflight request” for '
                 'POSTs with content type “application/json” asking the '
                 'destination API “are you allowed to accept requests from my '
                 'domain?” If the destination API does not answer “yes,” the '
                 'browser will block the request. Before the patched versions, '
                 'Argo CD did not validate that requests contained the correct '
                 'content type header. So an attacker could bypass the '
                 'browser’s CORS check by setting the content type to '
                 'something which is considered “not sensitive” such as '
                 '“text/plain.” The browser wouldn’t send the preflight '
                 'request, and Argo CD would happily accept the contents '
                 '(which are actually still JSON) and perform the requested '
                 'action (such as running malicious code). A patch for this '
                 'vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD '
                 'versions: 2.10-rc2, 2.9.4, 2.8.8, and 2.7.15. The patch '
                 'contains a breaking API change. The Argo CD API will no '
                 'longer accept non-GET requests which do not specify '
                 'application/json as their Content-Type. The accepted content '
                 'types list is configurable, and it is possible (but '
                 'discouraged) to disable the content type check completely. '
