first half of sem was talking about what dataset is good, because ther are a couple.
turns out NVD is the only real one wtih substatial data / no point adding more for noise cuz they overlap.

scientific approach section


Discussion scetion
- we found that x based on sec prev this means that it does/doesn't fit my story from intro. because of this finding, my futrure work might entail this.
- extra interesting thigns that popped up because of test.

but lots of homies say that NVD is rubbish, also, that CVSS is rubbish.
lets deep dive into that,

turns out, data is X, a little shit a little good,
things its good at (a bit more scientific)
things its bad at

# CONCLUSUION
ties first and second half together

future work witch flows form shit you didn't get time for

Appendix
i did a lot graphs. here ya go.


# SECIENTIFC SECTIONS

1. reasoning for test
2. methodology
3. hypothesis
4. results
5. breakdown of results: what you see->if its good or bad-> why thats the case-> what that means (imediate results)-> what that means for the story as awhole
