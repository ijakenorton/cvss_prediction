    abstract = {Current vulnerability scoring mechanisms in complex
                cyber-physical systems ({CPSs}) face challenges induced by the
                proliferation of both component versions and recurring
                scoring-mechanism versions. Di�erent data-repository sources like
                National Vulnerability Database ({NVD}), vendor websites as well
                as third party security tool analysers (e.g. {ICS} {CERT} and {
                VulDB}) may provide con�icting severity scores. We propose a
                machine-learning pipeline mechanism to compute vulnerability
                severity scores automatically. This method also discovers score
                correlations from established sources to infer and enhance the
                severity consistency of reported vulnerabilities. To evaluate our
                approach, we show through a {CPS}-based case study how our
                proposed scoring system automatically synthesises accurate scores
                for some vulnerability instances, to support remediation
                decision-making processes. In this case study, we also analyse
                the characteristics of {CPS} vulnerability instances.},
